&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created multiple projects in Scratch, but the final project legitimate one. We created a side scrolling <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; game where the sprites/characters weren't moving but the back drop was. Many popular games today use this method, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such as Sonic or Mario. My team's game took a different take on the idea and decided instead of having the character <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'running somewhere, we can make it more simple by having the items falling. The game was called Mary Moo's and the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objective was to catch more ice cream scoops than the opposing player in 60 seconds. </p>
