<p style ="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created multiple projects in Scratch, during Girls Who Code, but the final project was the legitimate one. We created <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a side scrolling game where the sprites/characters weren't moving but the back drop was. Many popular games today use <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this method, such as Sonic or Mario. My team's game took a different take on the idea and decided instead of having the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; character 'running somewhere, we can make it more simple by having the items falling. The game was called Mary Moo's and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the objective was to catch more ice cream scoops than the opposing player in 60 seconds. </p>
