<h2 style ="font-family: Times New Roman"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scratch: </h2>
<p style ="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I created multiple projects in Scratch, during Girls Who Code, but the final project was the legitimate one. We created <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a side scrolling game where the sprites/characters weren't moving but the back drop was. Many popular games today use <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this method, such as Sonic or Mario. My team's game took a different take on the idea and decided instead of having the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; character 'running somewhere, we can make it more simple by having the items falling. The game was called Mary Moo's and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the objective was to catch more ice cream scoops than the opposing player in 60 seconds. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the other considerably large projects I made on Scratch happened to be a part of my Physics final. For some random <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexplained reason, my somewhat insane teacher had our last unit on coding. If you look inside the code, there are notes <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; posted where the requirements of the projects were fulfilled. The entire theme of the game was space. The goal is to collect <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as many stars as possible while avoiding the asteroids. </p>

<h2 style ="font-family: Times New Roman"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Python: </h2>
<p style ="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next language I got myself familiar with was Python. The first step I took was to learn how to hack my own computer before <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually opening python. In the command prompt of the computer you can open or locate documents, but with my computer I decided <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to create another game. An easy summarization of the game is a digital interactive game. The context is that the player is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an Afro_Latina woman who created a time machine. The team I created this game forced the player to travel throught the past with <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the possibility ofdeath at every turn. We all decided that it was important to recognize the character's race and gender to have <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the player more easily understand the circumstances of some situations, since both race and gender played a major role in history.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second project we got to complete in python was the Obama-con project. The point was to try and put a filter on a new image <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that it resembles the Obam's campaign poster from 2008. I decided to take a similar route and created Dwayne the Rock Johnson's <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; campaign poster for 2020. #Hope2020 #VoteTheRock. On a more serious note, the way I completed this was to find the pixels... </p>
